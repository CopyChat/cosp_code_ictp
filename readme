#==========================================
# to run the simulator

./prepare-input-file-SUBEX.sh  # produce the inputs of cosp simulater from regcm output
                               # could be submitted to pbs by cosp.job
                               # for MICRO, please find the code in ex_2/output, almost the same

./cosp_test             # produce clouds, each timestep in one directory named as cloud_year-$mon-$timestep
                        # could be submitted to pbs by call_cosp.job

NOTE: pay attention to the simulator (cosp_test) output directory and the file inside, whose name is shifted by +1 timestep.
